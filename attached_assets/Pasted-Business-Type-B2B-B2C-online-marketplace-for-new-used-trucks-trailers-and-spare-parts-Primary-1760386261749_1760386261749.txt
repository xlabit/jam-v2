Business Type: B2B/B2C online marketplace for new & used trucks, trailers, and spare parts.

Primary Brand Colors: Deep Blue (#002b4f), Yellow-Orange (#ffb629), White (#ffffff)

Hero tagline: “Heavy Vehicles. Verified. Delivered.”

Keep all buttons, dropdowns, icons, and tabs functional — no backend or layout change.

🎨 Design Objective

Enhance the visual tone of the hero area for stronger emotional and professional impact — achieving a premium industrial feel while preserving clarity and readability.

The new hero should:

Look trustworthy and premium

Create depth and visual hierarchy

Improve conversion focus (draw eyes toward search and CTA)

Reflect transport, logistics, and automotive industry

Load fast (no heavy video loops unless optimized)

🧩 Core Direction: “Modern Industrial Blue Gradient”

Implement a rich gradient overlay with subtle depth and metallic precision to replace the current flat color.

Gradient Specification:

Direction: top-left → bottom-right

Start color: #002b4f (deep navy)

Mid color: #004a7c (blue steel)

End color: #0073c0 (vibrant cyan blue)

Overlay: 10–15% texture or noise (optional) to mimic metal surface depth.

Add a subtle glow highlight near the search bar area to draw attention to CTAs without distracting.

💡 Optional Enhancement Alternatives

If Replit AI supports variant generation, offer these optional themes for user preview:

Option A: Real Image Overlay

Use a hero background image showing a truck fleet on highway at sunrise or logistics yard.

Overlay: #002b4f with 70% opacity.

Blur radius: 5–10px for readability.

Keep text and elements 100% readable.

Option B: Blueprint Overlay

Background: same blue gradient (#002b4f → #004a7c).

Add faint white blueprint lines or vector truck outlines (opacity 10–15%) in background.

Symbolizes engineering precision and trust.

Option C: Metallic Gradient

Gradient from steel gray-blue (#3c5263) to deep navy (#002b4f).

Add 3–5% diagonal light reflection for realism.

Looks industrial, durable, and premium.

Option D: Abstract Mesh

Modern mesh gradient (blue → gray → white).

Light flow shapes to represent movement and trade.

Perfect for minimal, global look.

🔧 Implementation Notes

Do not modify layout, buttons, tabs, or dropdown functionality.

Adjust text and button color contrast (if necessary) for WCAG accessibility:

White text (#ffffff) on dark blue

Yellow-orange CTA buttons (#ffb629) should stay unchanged.

Optimize all visual assets for web (compressed <200kb).

Maintain responsiveness across devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

🧱 Deliverable Checklist

Replace hero background with selected theme (Gradient / Image / Blueprint / Mesh).

Test text and button legibility on all devices.

Maintain consistency with brand colors and typography.

Export and preview 2–3 visual variants for review before deployment.

🧭 Optional Design Guidance for AI

Use visual psychology to enhance focus:

Keep search bar area slightly illuminated (subtle spotlight gradient or radial fade).

Create mild contrast transition from darker top → lighter middle → darker bottom to guide user eye movement.

Ensure hero section feels trustworthy, professional, and tech-oriented.
