Role: Act as a senior product designer + growth UX specialist.
Deliverables: 1) High-fidelity homepage mockups (desktop/tablet/mobile), 2) a clickable prototype, 3) a UI kit (tokens + components), and 4) a tidy handoff spec (spacing, grids, states).
Tech context: Frontend will be built in Next.js. Design should be dev-friendly and performance-minded.

0) Inputs

Brand: Jain Automart

Logo: (use the provided file) — derive color tokens from the logo’s primaries.

Existing site (keep the same section order): https://www.jainautomart.com/
 (a full-page screenshot is provided—mirror the section sequence).

Competitors for inspiration (do not copy):

https://trucks.cardekho.com/

https://trucks.tractorjunction.com/

https://www.trucksbuses.com/

1) Goals (ranked)

Generate quality leads: Calls, WhatsApp, “Get Best Price”, “Request Callback”, “Send Enquiry”, and “Book Inspection/Test Drive”.

Help users find vehicles fast: Prominent search, clear taxonomy (New/Used, Body Type, Make/Model), filters, and comparison hooks.

Build trust: Dealer credibility, numbers, OEM partner logos, customer stories, star ratings, badges (Warranty/RC Verified/Financing).

Keep SEO intact: Preserve content density and section order; improve scannability without losing text volume.

2) Audience & Primary Journeys

Buyers of heavy vehicles (trucks, trailers, tippers, tractors, tankers).

Common intents: “Buy a used tipper in Jaipur” / “Compare new Tata tractor variants” / “Finance options” / “Sell or exchange existing truck.”

3) Brand & Tone

Professional, reliable, enterprise-grade.

Visual language: sturdy, industrial, confident; avoid gimmicks.

Motion: subtle, purposeful; no flashy parallax.

4) Layout Rules

Preserve section sequence from the current homepage, but modernize each section’s UI.

Grid: 12-column desktop (1140–1200px max content width), 8-col tablet, 4-col mobile.

Spacing scale: 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 px.

Type: Recommend Inter or Poppins (system-safe fallback).

Color tokens:

--brand-primary: sampled from logo primary

--brand-accent: sampled from logo secondary

--neutral-900/700/500/300/100: slate/gray scale for text and surfaces

--success, --warning, --danger for badges and alerts

Buttons: Primary (filled), Secondary (outline), Tertiary (text). Strong hover/focus/disabled states.

5) Above-the-Fold (Hero) — Conversion Engine

Headline (value-led): “Heavy Vehicles. Verified. Delivered.”

Subhead: “Buy new & used trucks, trailers, and tippers with transparent pricing, inspection, and easy finance.”

Primary CTA group (sticky on mobile):

Get Best Price (modal form)

Request Callback

WhatsApp (deep link)

Search Bar (prominent, card style):

Tabs: New | Used

Inputs: Body Type (Truck/Trailer/Tipper/… ), Make (Tata, Ashok Leyland, …), City/State

Button: Find Vehicles

Trust Strip under hero: badges (“RC Verified”, “Financing Available”, “Pan-India Delivery”, “Warranty Options”)

Hero media: rotating banner or static vehicle in studio-style lighting with subtle scroll-fade.

6) Section-by-Section Redesign (keep same order as current site)

For each existing section on jainautomart.com, redesign with these patterns. If a section doesn’t exist, do not add it here—only refactor the one that exists, in place.

A) Category Navigator (if present early)

Card grid with large pictograms: Truck, Trailer, Tipper, Tanker, Reefer, Container, Tractor, Bus.

Each card: image, title, “X Listings”, CTA → category PLP.

Hover: small lift + shadow; on mobile → full-bleed row cards.

B) Featured Listings (New & Used)

Toggle: New | Used

Carousel (desktop) / scroll cards (mobile).

Card anatomy:

Image with Verified ribbon & watermark

Title (Year Make Model Variant)

Key specs inline: Axle • GVW • BS-VI • City

Price (₹) + badge “Negotiable” if applicable

CTAs: View Details, Get Best Price, WhatsApp

Microcopy: “Financing Available • RC Verified • Low KM”

C) Brands / OEMs

Horizontal logo marquee with filter chips for Makes (Tata, Leyland, BharatBenz, Volvo…).

Click → brand landing (SEO, not just filter).

D) Body Type Finder

Iconic tiles (Tipper, Trailer, Reefer, Container, Tanker…).

Show counts; clicking applies deep link to PLP with filters.

E) Why Jain Automart (Trust Section)

3–4 value props with icons:

“Verified Documents”

“100+ Cities Served”

“Financing & Insurance”

“Expert Inspection”

Add a numbers band (Inventory, Cities, Happy Customers).

F) Finance & Insurance CTA

Split panel: Get Pre-Approved form + partner logos.

Micro-form (Name, Phone, Vehicle Type, City) → Submit → Thank-you.

G) Customer Stories / Testimonials

Real photos, 1–2 line quotes, star rating, city.

Carousel with dots; ensure good contrast.

H) Blog / Guides (SEO)

3–6 cards with thumb, category, title, read time.

CTA: Read more → Blog PLP. Keep content density high for SEO.

I) FAQ (Collapsible)

6–8 top buyer questions (finance, RC, delivery, warranty).

Schema-ready copy (FAQPage).

J) Footer

Conversion hooks repeated: “Call”, “WhatsApp”, “Get Best Price”.

Quick links: Categories, Brands, Finance, Sell Your Vehicle, Service Centers, Blog, About, Contact.

Compliance: Address, CIN/GST, social, copyright.

7) Micro-Conversions & Lead Capture

Sticky CTA bar on mobile: Call | WhatsApp | Get Best Price | Filters.

Exit-intent modal: “Send me best matches” (Name, Phone, City, Body Type).

Compare mini-drawer: Add up to 3 vehicles; CTA “Compare Now”.

Inline lead widgets on carousels: “Get Best Price”.

8) Navigation & IA

Top Nav: Categories (mega-menu by Body Type), Brands, New, Used, Service Centers, Finance, Blog.

Right cluster: Search, Compare, Call, WhatsApp.

Breadcrumbs on inner pages for SEO.

9) Accessibility & Performance

Color contrast ≥ WCAG AA.

Keyboard & focus states visible.

LCP target: < 2.5s.

Use responsive images (srcset), lazy-load non-LCP, avoid blocking JS, compress hero art.

10) Content & Copy (starter)

Short, concrete, benefit-led.

Avoid jargon where possible; keep spec labels consistent with PLP/PDP.

Button copy examples:

Primary: “Get Best Price”, “Find Vehicles”, “Request Callback”

Secondary: “View Details”, “Compare”

Micro: “WhatsApp Now”, “Book Inspection”

11) Analytics & Experimentation

Track: hero search interactions, CTA clicks (by placement), form starts/submits, WhatsApp clicks, filter usage, compare starts/completes.

A/B ideas:

Hero: Search-first vs. CTA-first layout

Sticky CTA variations (3 vs 4 buttons)

“Get Best Price” copy variants

12) UI Kit (deliver as a page in the file)

Tokens: colors, type scale (H1 40/48 → H6 16/24), shadows, radii (8/12/16), spacing.

Components: header, mega-menu, search bar (tabbed), filter chips, listing card, brand tile, testimonial card, FAQ accordion, CTA buttons, sticky bar, lead modal, footer blocks.

States: default/hover/active/disabled/loading/success/error.

13) Hand-off & Spec

Provide redlines (spacing), grid overlays, and component annotations.

Export asset guidance (hero 1920×700 webp; cards 4:3 webp; brand logos SVG).

Document Lottie/json for subtle hero animation (optional).

14) Acceptance Criteria

 Sections appear in the same sequence as the current site, modernized per spec.

 Above-the-fold contains search + primary CTAs + trust strip.

 Three responsive breakpoints (desktop/tablet/mobile) designed.

 Listing cards include key specs + price + trust badges and 3 CTAs (Details, Best Price, WhatsApp).

 Sticky mobile CTA bar present across the page.

 Accessibility, performance and SEO considerations incorporated.

 UI kit + component library provided.

 Prototype links and notes for dev hand-off included.

Optional: Designer Prompts for Imagery/Icon Style

Hero imagery prompt: “Studio-lit heavy truck (6×4) on neutral background, crisp edges, subtle tire reflections, modern industrial vibe—clean, high-contrast, no background clutter.”

Icon style: “Simple, geometric, duotone icons with rounded corners; consistent stroke, legible at 16–24px.”
