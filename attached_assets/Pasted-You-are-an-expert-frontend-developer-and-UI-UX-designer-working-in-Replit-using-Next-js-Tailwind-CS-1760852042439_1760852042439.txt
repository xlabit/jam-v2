You are an expert frontend developer and UI/UX designer working in Replit using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and the Metronic theme system.
Rebuild the “Our Manufacturing Categories” section to look premium, modern, and conversion-oriented — visually sharp, professional, and trustworthy.
The existing version looks plain and amateur. The goal is to make it feel clean, high-end, and enterprise-level without clutter.

OBJECTIVE

Redesign the 6-category grid into a visually balanced, card-based layout that feels elegant, structured, and brand-consistent.
Keep the same content (6 categories, same text, links, and order).
Make every card feel intentional, clickable, and part of a cohesive visual system.

DESIGN SYSTEM

Use a modern automotive-inspired visual language:

Color palette: Deep navy #002b4f, industrial gray #f5f6fa, white #ffffff, accent orange/red #ffb629 or #da251c.

Typography: Use Poppins or Inter (weights 400, 600, 700). High contrast headings, lighter descriptive copy.

Spacing: More generous white space; consistent vertical rhythm; avoid cramped blocks.

LAYOUT STRUCTURE

Section container:

ID: our-manufacturing-category

Full width light gray background (#f9fafb)

Content max-width: 1200px centered

Padding: 100px top / 120px bottom (desktop)

Section heading:

“Our Manufacturing Categories” centered

Subtitle: “Explore our expertise across industry-leading vehicle builds.”

Heading font-weight 700, size 40px desktop / 28px mobile, line-height 1.2

Subtitle muted gray #6b6b6b, size 16px, margin-top 8px

Add a thin accent bar below heading (4px high, 60px wide, brand orange) for a premium cue.

GRID

3 columns × 2 rows desktop

2 columns tablet

1 column stacked mobile

Gap between cards: 40px desktop, 24px tablet/mobile

Each card equal height, ~300–340px.

CARD DESIGN (Premium look)

Each card must look like a polished interactive tile with layered visual hierarchy.

Card base:

Background: white (#ffffff)

Border radius: 20px

Shadow: subtle but clean (0 8px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.05))

Border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.04)

Internal padding: 28–32px

Display: flex column; image top, text bottom.

Image:

Aspect ratio 16:9, object-fit cover or contain.

All trucks visually aligned; consistent cropping.

Add soft drop shadow and subtle rounded corners on images.

Use light gray background block behind images for structure if needed.

Hover effect: image zooms in slightly (scale 1.05, transition 250ms ease-out).

Title + Description:

Title: bold, 18px, dark navy text.

Description: 15px muted gray, line-height 1.6, margin-top 6px.

Align left on desktop, center on mobile.

Maintain consistent spacing above/below text.

Hover state:

Card slightly lifts (translateY(-8px)),
box-shadow intensifies (0 12px 28px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)),
and bottom accent bar slides in with brand color.

CTA microtext “Explore Now →” fades in below description (color accent orange).

Focus/keyboard state:

Outline: 3px solid brand orange (#ffb629), visible and accessible.

MICRO-INTERACTIONS

Smooth hover transitions for lift and image zoom (200–300ms ease).

Subtle gradient background fade on hover (linear-gradient(180deg, rgba(255,182,41,0.05) 0%, #ffffff 100%)).

Cursor pointer for full card.

Use only GPU-friendly CSS transforms (translate, scale, opacity).

COPY AND ORDER (keep same)

Trailers — Heavy-duty trailers for long-haul transport.

Tippers — Durable tippers for mining & construction.

Tankers & Bulkers — Safe transport for liquids & bulk materials.

Body Building — Custom body solutions for diverse payloads.

Container — Standard & specialized containers for logistics.

Tip Trailers — High-strength tip trailers for heavy loads.

DATA ATTRIBUTES AND ACCESSIBILITY

Each card:

data-cms-key for title, desc, image, and link

data-event="category_click_[slug]"

data-test-id="cat_[slug]"

aria-label="View [Category] category"

Images alt text descriptive (e.g., “Tippers for mining and construction”)

Entire card clickable (wrap <a>)

PERFORMANCE

Lazy load all images.

Use responsive srcset for faster loads.

Limit images to ~120 KB optimized WebP.

RESPONSIVENESS

On mobile, image full width top, text below centered.

Padding reduces to 16–20px.

Font sizes scale proportionally.

Maintain same hover effect on tap with smooth active feedback.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENT

Generate the full React component in Next.js (OurManufacturingCategories.jsx or .tsx).
Use Tailwind utility classes for layout, typography, colors, spacing, transitions.
Export default functional component.
Provide one sample usage import line and example usage snippet for the homepage.
Include short comments for customization (images, CMS data).
No unnecessary explanation text—only code and minimal comments.

Acceptance checklist:

Section visually premium and cohesive.

Heading and subtitle well balanced.

6 polished cards in consistent grid.

Smooth animations, hover/focus visible.

Fully responsive.

Accessible and optimized.

Now generate the clean React component code implementing this upgraded design exactly.
